    """Compute the Region Adjacency Graph using mean colors.

    Given an image and its initial segmentation, this method constructs the
    corresponsing Region Adjacency Graph (RAG). Each node in the RAG
    represents a set of pixels within `image` with the same label in `labels`.
    The weight between two adjacent regions represents how similar or
    dissimilar two regions are depending on the `mode` parameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    image : ndarray, shape(M, N, [..., P,] 3)
        Input image.
    labels : ndarray, shape(M, N, [..., P,])
        The labelled image. This should have one dimension less than
        `image`. If `image` has dimensions `(M, N, 3)` `labels` should have
         dimensions `(M, N)`.
    connectivity : int, optional
        Pixels with a squared distance less than `connectivity` from each other
        are considered adjacent. It can range from 1 to `labels.ndim`. Its
        behavior is the same as `connectivity` parameter in
        `scipy.ndimage.filters.generate_binary_structure`.
    mode : {'distance', 'similarity'}, optional
        The strategy to assign edge weights.

            'distance' : The weight between two adjacent regions is the
            :math:`|c_1 - c_2|`, where :math:`c_1` and :math:`c_2` are the mean
            colors of the two regions. It represents the Euclidean distance in
            their average color.

            'similarity' : The weight between two adjacent is
            :math:`e^{-d^2/sigma}` where :math:`d=|c_1 - c_2|`, where
            :math:`c_1` and :math:`c_2` are the mean colors of the two regions.
            It represents how similar two regions are.
    sigma : float, optional
        Used for computation when `mode` is "similarity". It governs how
        close to each other two colors should be, for their corresponding edge
        weight to be significant. A very large value of `sigma` could make
        any two colors behave as though they were similar.

    Returns
    -------
    out : RAG
        The region adjacency graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from skimage import data, graph, segmentation
    >>> img = data.lena()
    >>> labels = segmentation.slic(img)
    >>> rag = graph.rag_mean_color(img, labels)
